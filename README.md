## What is RdPro (Recursive Directory Removal Pro)

* A Powerful Recursive Directory Removal/Purge Utility.  It transverse huge directory structures to find and pruge directories buried deep. All files under the the targeted directories will be deleted. 
* Super-fast. faster than rm.  Multiple threads are used to perform tasks in parallel. Algorithm makes a difference! 
* Can remove a directory user specified which is nested and spread out under a huge directory structure. I found rm is lacking on this feature and it is the main driver for me to start writing this tool. For exmaple, it allows me to remove all the maven created target directories (contains classes) under all my projects so that allows me to back up the source code only wihtout the generated classes. 
* No problem removing files and directories with long names which windows sometime can't handle.  No more â€œThe file name is too long" issue. 
* It is a java application and can run on all the platforms where java is supported. Requires JRE/JDK to be installed on the machine for it to run. 
* The deleted files do not go to the recycle bin and can't be recovered. Make sure you read the disclaimer and understand what to expect. 

## Tech Stack
The project is a good showcase of the 
* GUI builder with maven in IntelliJ IDEA to build a Swing GUI.
* Multi threading using java concurrent ThreadPoolExecutor to performs tasks in parallel.
* Recursive walk algorithem.
